Easy knowledge-based game. Rules are pretty straightforward. If you know the game "AZ quiz" (known in the Czech Republic), then you're ready to go.

The goal is clear. Connect sides of some pattern (usually a triangle etc.) with circles of your color. But how? Just answer knowledge-based questions correctly and on time, and the moderator will award your circle with color.

You can create an unlimited amount of games and questions yourself.
